# GreaterGlider
A pipeline for sequence simulation (INDELible), ML tree reconstruction (IQTree), and site-concordance branch support measurement.

GreaterGlider.pl is a Perl written software pipeline for linux operating systems, allowing sequence simulation (INDELible) combined with ML tree reconstruction (IQTree) and subsequent conducted branch support estimation using the site-concordance (sCF) measure (IQTree2). To enable all three pipeline stages (simulation, ML recosntruction, and branch support measure) and thus a re-analysis of the original sCF study of K端ck et al 2022, the pipeline consists a reduced source code of the more comprehensive, module based Appetite-pipeline (originally used in K端ck et al. 2022). Processing greaterGlider.pl in default mode (perl greaterGlider <enter>) conducts a re-analysis of the ten tree-setups /T1 to T10) as published in K端ck et al. 2022 with alpha=0.5. For other alpha values used by K端ck et al. 2022, change the respective parameter in the script.
